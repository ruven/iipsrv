Service and configuration scripts for Systemd-based init systems
================================================================

Installation
------------

Copy and rename (remove the .fcgi suffix) the iipsrv executable to the /use/sbin/ directory:

    src/iipsrv.fcgi -> /usr/sbin/iipsrv

Copy the systemd files to the following locations:

Service script:
    iipsrv.service -> /lib/systemd/system/iipsrv.service

Environment variables for iipsrv that can be modified:
    iipsrv.conf -> /etc/default/iipsrv


Starting iipsrv
---------------

    % systemctl start iipsrv

To view the latest systemd messages concerning iipsrv:

    % journalctl -eu iipsrv


Modifying the scripts
---------------------

If you wish to modify the behaviour of service script without changing the file itself,
create a drop-in by creating the directory: /etc/systemd/system/iipsrv.service.d/
and adding a file "00-iipsrv.conf" to it containing the changes.

For example, to change the user and group under which iipsrv runs to "daemon",
add this to your 00-iipsrv.conf drop-in:

    [Service]
    User=daemon
    Group=daemon
