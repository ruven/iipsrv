    * has completed its initialization and is ready to accept
    * a request.  Subsequent calls to FCGI_accept indicate that

    * FCGIaccept first flushes any buffered output to the HTTP server.

    * streams that understand FastCGI protocol and take input from
    * the HTTP server send output and error output to the HTTP server,

    * System.err respectively.

    * this method catches, but doen't throw Exceptions.
