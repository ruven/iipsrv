      <P>
         FastCGI is an open extension to CGI that provides high performance for all Internet applications without the
         penalties of Web server APIs.
      </P>
      <P>
         FastCGI is designed to be layered on top of existing Web server APIs. For instance, the <TT>mod_fastcgi</TT>
         Apache module adds FastCGI support to the Apache server. FastCGI can also be used, with reduced functionality
         and reduced performance, on any Web server that supports CGI.
      </P>
      <P>
         This FastCGI Developer&#39;s Kit is designed to make developing FastCGI applications easy. The kit currently
         supports FastCGI applications written in C/C++, Perl, Tcl, and Java.
      </P>
      <P>
         This document:
      </P>
      <UL TYPE="square">
         <LI>
            Describes how to configure and build the kit for your development platform.

            Tells how to write applications using the libraries in the kit.
         </LI>
         <LI>
            Tells how to run applications using Web servers that support FastCGI or using any Web server and
            <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT>.
         </LI>
      </UL>
      <P>
         The kit includes a <A HREF="fastcgi-whitepaper/fastcgi.htm">technical white paper</A>,
         <TT>doc/fastcgi-whitepaper/fastcgi.htm</TT>. You should read at least the first three sections of the
         technical white paper before starting to write FastCGI applications. The <A HREF="fcgi-perf.htm">performance
         paper</A> will help you understand how application design affects performance with FastCGI.
      </P>
      <P>
         The <A HREF="fcgi-spec.html">FastCGI Specification</A>, <TT>doc/fcgi-spec.html</TT>, defines the interface
         between a FastCGI application and a Web server that supports FastCGI. The software in the kit implements the
         specification. You don&#39;t need to read the specification in order to write applications.
      </P>
      <P>
         Additional information is provided in the <A HREF="http://fastcgi.com/docs/faq.html">FAQ</A> document, which
         contains frequently asked questions about application development using FastCGI, as well as some general
         information.
      </P>
      <P>
         Experience with CGI programming will be extremely valuable in writing FastCGI applications. If you don&#39;t
         have enough experience with CGI programming, you should read one of the popular books on the topic or study
         the <A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">NCSA CGI page</A>. For a more formal treatment of CGI/1.1 see
         the <A HREF="http://cgi-spec.golux.com/">Internet Draft CGI 1.1 Specification</A>.

         <A NAME="S2">2. Getting started</A>

      <P>
         The kit is a compressed tar (tar.Z) file, distributed via the <A HREF="http://fastcgi.com/">fastcgi.com</A>
         Web page. Unpacking the tar file creates a new directory <TT>fcgi-devel-kit</TT>.
      </P>
      <P>
         Open the kit&#39;s index page, <TT>fcgi-devel-kit/index.html</TT>, using the &quot;Open File&quot; command in
         your Web browser. The index page gives you an overview of the kit structure and helps you navigate the kit.
         The index page also contains links that run some example applications, but the applications won&#39;t work
         when index.html is opened using the &quot;Open File&quot; command because they aren&#39;t aren&#39;t being
         accessed through a Web server.
      </P>
      <P>
         In order to use the kit in earnest you&#39;ll need a Web server that you control, a Web server running with
         your user ID. The Web server will be starting FastCGI applications that you will need to debug; this will be a
         lot more convenient for you if these processes run with your user ID. It is best to have a Web server that
         supports FastCGI. <A HREF="#S4">Section 4</A> discusses Web server issues.
      </P>
      <P>
         If you can, keep the kit on a file system accessible from your personal workstation, do your builds on your
         workstation, and run your Web server on your workstation. If that&#39;s not possible, arrange a configuration
         such that the kit is accessible from the machine that&#39;s going to run your Web server, and build the kit
         and your applications on a machine that&#39;s configured exactly the same way (same processor architecture,
         operating system, etc.) as the machine that&#39;s going to run your Web server.
      </P>
      <P>
         To build the kit you execute this sequence of commands in the <TT>fcgi-devel-kit</TT> directory:

      <P>
         The <TT>fcgi_stdio</TT> library provides the easiest transition for C CGI programs and C CGI programmers to
         FastCGI. Using this library your application can run using either CGI or FastCGI, with the same binary for
         both situations.
      </P>
      <P>
         To introduce the <TT>fcgi_stdio</TT> library we give a pair of examples: a tiny CGI program and the
         translation of this program to FastCGI. These two example programs are included in the kit.
      </P>
      <P>
         The CGI program is <TT>examples/tiny-cgi.c</TT>:

<PRE>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

    void main(void)
    {
        int count = 0;
        printf(&quot;Content-type: text/html\r\n&quot;

         The key features of this tiny CGI program are:
      </P>
      <UL TYPE="square">
         <LI>
            The program sends data to the Web server by writing to <TT>stdout</TT>, using <TT>printf</TT> in this
            example. The CGI program first sends a <TT>Content-type</TT> header, then a small HTML document. The
            program includes <TT>stdio.h</TT> in order to get access to the <TT>printf</TT> function.
         </LI>
         <LI>
            The program obtains parameters provided by the Web server by reading environment variables. The CGI program
            reads the <TT>SERVER_NAME</TT> variable using <TT>getenv</TT> and includes the value in the HTML document.
            The program includes <TT>stdlib.h</TT> in order to get access to the <TT>getenv</TT> function.

      </UL>
      <P>
         The <TT>count</TT> variable is degenerate in this example; the CGI program runs a single request, so the
         request number is always one. This variable will be more interesting in the FastCGI example.

      <UL TYPE="square">
         <LI>
            The program is structured as a loop that begins by calling the function <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT>. The
            <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT> function blocks until a new request arrives for the program to execute. The program
            includes <TT>fcgi_stdio.h</TT> in order to get access to the <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT> function.
         </LI>
         <LI>
            Within the loop, <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT> creates a CGI-compatible world. <TT>printf</TT> and <TT>getenv</TT>
            operate just as in the CGI program. <TT>stdin</TT> and <TT>stderr</TT>, not used by this tiny program, also
            operate just as in a CGI program.
         </LI>
      </UL>
      <P>
         The <TT>count</TT> variable increments each time through the loop, so the program displays a new request
         number each time. You can use the reload button in your browser to demonstrate this, once you&#39;ve got the

      </P>
      <P>
         You can use CGI to run application binaries built with the <TT>fcgi_stdio</TT> library. The
         <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT> function tests its environment to determine how the application was invoked. If it was
         invoked as a CGI program, the first call to FCGI_Accept is essentially a no-op and the second call returns
         <TT>-1</TT>. In effect, the request loop disappears.
      </P>
      <P>
         Of course, when a FastCGI application is run using CGI it does not get the benefits of FastCGI. For instance,
         the application exits after servicing a single request, so it cannot maintain cached information.
      </P>
      <H4>
         Implementation details
      </H4>
      <P>
         <TT>fcgi_stdio.h</TT> works by first including <TT>stdio.h</TT>, then defining macros to replace essentially
         all of the types and procedures defined in <TT>stdio.h</TT>. (<TT>stdio.h</TT> defines a few procedures that
         have nothing to do with <TT>FILE *</TT>, such as <TT>sprintf</TT> and <TT>sscanf</TT>; <TT>fcgi_stdio.h</TT>
         doesn&#39;t replace these.) For instance, <TT>FILE</TT> becomes <TT>FCGI_FILE</TT> and <TT>printf</TT> becomes
         <TT>FCGI_printf</TT>. You&#39;ll only see these new names if you read <TT>fcgi_stdio.h</TT> or examine your C
         source code after preprocessing.
      </P>
      <P>
         Here are some consequences of this implementation technique:
      </P>
      <UL TYPE="square">
         <LI>
            On some platforms the implementation will break if you include <TT>stdio.h</TT> after including
            <TT>fcgi_stdio.h</TT>, because <TT>stdio.h</TT> often defines macros for functions such as <TT>getc</TT>
            and <TT>putc</TT>. Fortunately, on most platforms <TT>stdio.h</TT> is protected against multiple includes
            by lines near the top of the file that look like 
<PRE>
    #ifndef _STDIO_H
    #define _STDIO_H
   
</PRE>
            <P>
               The specific symbol used for multiple-include protection, <TT>_STDIO_H</TT> in this example, varies from
               platform to platform. As long as your platform protects <TT>stdio.h</TT> against multiple includes, you
               can forget about this issue.
            </P>
         </LI>
         <LI>
            If your application passes <TT>FILE *</TT> to functions implemented in libraries for which you have source
            code, then you&#39;ll want to recompile these libraries with <TT>fcgi_stdio.h</TT> included. Most C
            compilers provide a command-line option for including headers in a program being compiled; using such a
            compiler feature allows you to rebuild your libraries without making source changes. For instance the gcc
            command line 
<PRE>
    gcc -include /usr/local/include/fcgi_stdio.h wonderlib.c
   
</PRE>
            <P>
               causes gcc to include <TT>fcgi_stdio.h</TT> before it even begins to read the module
               <TT>wonderlib.c</TT>.
            </P>
         </LI>
         <LI>
            If your application passes <TT>FILE *</TT> to functions implemented in libraries for which you do not have
            source code, then you&#39;ll need to include the headers for these libraries <I>before</I> you include
            <TT>fcgi_stdio.h</TT>. You can&#39;t pass the <TT>stdin</TT>, <TT>stdout</TT>, or <TT>stderr</TT> streams
            produced by <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT> to any functions implemented by these libraries. You can pass a stream on
            a Unix file to a library function by following this pattern:

         Converting CGI programs
      </H4>
      <P>
         The main task in converting a CGI program into a FastCGI program is separating the code that needs to execute
         once, initializing the program, from the code that needs to run for each request. In our tiny example,
         initializing the <TT>count</TT> variable is outside the loop, while incrementing the <TT>count</TT> variable
         goes inside.
      </P>
      <P>
         Retained application state may be an issue. You must ensure that any application state created in processing
         one request has no unintended effects on later requests. FastCGI offers the possibility of significant
         application performance improvements, through caching; it is up to you to make the caches work correctly.
      </P>
      <P>
         Storage leaks may be an issue. Many CGI programs don&#39;t worry about storage leaks because the programs
         don&#39;t run for long enough for bloating to be a problem. When converting to FastCGI, you can either use a
         tool such as <A HREF="http://www.pure.com/"><I>Purify</I></A> from Pure Software to discover and fix storage
         leaks, or you can run a C garbage collector such as <A HREF="http://www.geodesic.com/"><I>Great Circle</I></A>
         from Geodesic Systems.

         A major advantage of the FastCGI approach to high-performance Web applications is its language-neutrality. CGI

         applications.

      <P>
         We have produced FastCGI-integrated Perl and Tcl interpreters. Doing so was easy, since Perl and Tcl are
         conventional C applications and <TT>fcgi_stdio</TT> was designed for converting conventional C applications.
         Essentially no source code changes were required in these programs; a small amount of code was added in order
         to make <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT> and other FastCGI primitives available in these languages. And because these
         interpreters were developed using <TT>fcgi_stdio</TT>, they run standard Perl and Tcl applications (e.g. CGI

         the portion that performs per-request processing. You put the per-request processing into a loop controlled by
         <TT>FCGI::accept</TT> (Perl) or <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT> (Tcl).

         Some of the Web servers that support FastCGI perform management of FastCGI applications. You don&#39;t need to

         <A NAME="S4.2">4.2 Using <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> with any Web server</A>
      </H3>
      <P>
         The program <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> allows you to run FastCGI applications using any Web server that supports CGI.
      </P>
      <P>
         Here is how <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> works. <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> is a standard CGI program that uses Unix domain or
         TCP/IP sockets to communicate with a FastCGI application. <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> takes the path name or host/port
         name of a listening socket as a parameter and <TT>connect</TT>s to the FastCGI application listening on that
         socket. <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> then forwards the CGI environment variables and <TT>stdin</TT> data to the FastCGI
         application, and forwards the <TT>stdout</TT> and <TT>stderr</TT> data from the FastCGI application to the Web
         server. When the FastCGI application signals the end of its response, <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> flushes its buffers
         and exits.
      </P>
      <P>
         Obviously, having <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> is not as good as having a server with integrated FastCGI support:
      </P>
      <UL>
         <LI>
            Communication is slower than with a Web server that avoids the fork/exec overhead on every FastCGI request.
         </LI>
         <LI>
            <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> does not perform application management, so you need to provide this yourself.
         </LI>
         <LI>
            <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> supports only the Responder role.
         </LI>
      </UL>
      <P>
         But <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> does allow you to develop applications that retain state in memory between connections,
         which often provides a major performance boost over normal CGI. And all the applications you develop using
         <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> will work with Web servers that have integrated support for FastCGI.
      </P>
      <P>
         The file <TT>examples/tiny-fcgi.cgi</TT> demonstrates a way to use <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> to run a typical
         application, in this case the <TT>examples/tiny-fcgi</TT> application:

    #!../cgi-fcgi/cgi-fcgi -f
    -connect sockets/tiny-fcgi tiny-fcgi

      <P>
         On most Unix platforms, executing this command-interpreter file runs <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> with arguments
         <TT>-f</TT> and <TT>examples/tiny-fcgi.cgi</TT>. (Beware: On some Unix platforms, including HP-UX, the first
         line of a command-interpreter file cannot contain more than 32 characters, including the newline; you may need
         to install the <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> application in a standard place like <TT>/usr/local/bin</TT> or create a
         symbolic link to the <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> application in the directory containing your application.) The
         <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> program reads the command-interpreter file and connects to the FastCGI application whose
         listening socket is <TT>examples/sockets/tiny-fcgi</TT>.
      </P>
      <P>
         Continuing the example, if <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT>&#39;s connection attempt fails, it creates a new process running
         the program <TT>examples/tiny-fcgi</TT> and listening on socket <TT>examples/sockets/tiny-fcgi</TT>. Then
         <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> retries the connection attempt, which now should succeed.
      </P>
      <P>
         The <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> program has two other modes of operation. In one mode it connects to applications but
         does not start them; in the other it starts applications but does not connect to them. These modes are
         required when using TCP/IP. The <A HREF="cgi-fcgi.1"><TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> manpage</A>, <TT>doc/cgi-fcgi.1</TT>,
         tells the full story.
      </P>
      <P>
         To run the example applications using <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT>, start your Web server and give it the directory
         <TT>fcgi-devel-kit</TT> as the root of its URL space. If the machine running your server is called
         <TT>bowser</TT> and your server is running on port <TT>8888</TT>, you&#39;d then open the URL
         <TT>http://bowser:8888/index.html</TT> to reach the kit&#39;s index page. Now the links on the index page that
         run example applications via <TT>cgi-fcgi</TT> should be active.

      <P>
         On Digital UNIX 3.0 there&#39;s a problem with Unix domain listening sockets on NFS file systems. The symptom
         when using cgi-fcgi is an exit status of 38 (<TT>ENOTSOCK</TT>: socket operation on non-socket), but cgi-fcgi
         may dump core in this case when compiled optimized. Work-around: Store your Unix domain listening sockets on a
         non NFS file system, upgrade to Digital UNIX 3.2, or use TCP sockets.
      </P>
      <P>
         On AIX there&#39;s a problem with shared listening sockets. The symptoms can include application core dumps
         and kernel panic. Work-around: Run a single FastCGI application server per listening socket.
