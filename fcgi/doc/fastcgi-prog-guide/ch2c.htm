         This chapter explains how to code FastCGI applications in C and how to build them into executables.
      </P>
      <P>
         <A NAME="4230"></A> If you are converting a CGI application into a FastCGI application, in many cases you will
         only need to add a few lines of code. For more complex applications, you may also need to rearrange some code.

         The I/O Libraries
      </H1>
      <A NAME="5384"></A>
      <P>
         The FastCGI Software Development Kit that accompanies Open Market WebServer 2.0 includes I/O libraries to
         simplify the job of converting existing CGI applications to FastCGI or writing new FastCGI applications. There
         are two libraries in the kit: fcgi_stdio and fcgiapp. You must include one of these header files in your
         program:
      </P>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <UL>
         <LI CLASS="c2">
            <A NAME="5386"></A>
         </LI>
         <LI>
            <CODE>fcgi_stdio.h</CODE> <A NAME="4237"></A>
         </LI>
         <LI>
            <CODE>fcgiapp.h</CODE>
         </LI>
      </UL>
      <A NAME="4199"></A>
      <P>
         The <CODE>fcgi_stdio</CODE> library is a layer on top of the <CODE>fcgiapp</CODE> library, and we recommend
         strongly that you use it, both for converting existing CGI applications and for writing new FastCGI
         applications. The fcgi_stdio library offers several advantages:
      </P>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <UL>
         <LI CLASS="c2">
            <A NAME="5811"></A>
         </LI>
         <LI>
            Simplicity: there are only 3 new API calls to learn <A NAME="5828"></A>
         </LI>
         <LI>
            Familiarity: If you are converting a CGI application to FastCGI, you will find few changes between CGI and
            FastCGI. We designed our library to make the job of building a FastCGI application as similar as possible
            to that of building a FastCGI application: you use the same environment variables, same techniques for
            parsing query strings, the same I/O routines, and so on. <A NAME="5817"></A>
         </LI>
         <LI>
            Convenience: the library provides full binary compatibility between CGI and FastCGI. That is, you can run
            the same binary as either CGI or FastCGI.
         </LI>
      </UL>
      <A NAME="5399"></A>
      <P>
         The fcgiapp library is more specific to FastCGI, without trying to provide the veneer of familiarity with CGI.
         This manual describes the fcgi_stdio library; the fcgiapp library is documented in the header files that
         accompany the development kit.
      </P>

      <H1>
         Code Structure
      </H1>
      <A NAME="4240"></A>
      <P>
         To structure code for FastCGI, you separate your code into two sections:
      </P>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <UL>
         <LI CLASS="c2">
            <A NAME="4200"></A>
         </LI>
         <LI>
            Initialization section, which is executed only once. <A NAME="4201"></A>
         </LI>
         <LI>
            Response loop section, which gets executed every time the FastCGI script gets called.
         </LI>
      </UL>
      <A NAME="4202"></A>
      <P>
         A response loop typically has the following format:
      </P>
      <BR>
      <BR>
<PRE>
<A NAME="4203">while (FCGI_Accept() &gt;= 0) {
</A>
<A NAME="4204"># body of response loop
</A>
<A NAME="4205">}
</A>
</PRE>
      <A NAME="4206"></A>
      <P>
         The <CODE>FCGI_Accept</CODE> blocks until a client request comes in, and then returns 0. If there is a system
         failure, or the system administrator terminates the process, Accept will return -1.
      </P>
      <P>
         <A NAME="5852"></A> If the application was invoked as a CGI program, the first call to Accept returns 0 and
         the second always returns -1, producing CGI behavior. (See <A HREF="apaman.htm#95683">&quot;FCGI_Accept
         (3)&quot; on page  21</A> for details.)
      </P>
      <P>
         <A NAME="5909"></A> Also note that the CGI world encourages small scripts, whereas FastCGI encourages
         combining scripts. You may choose to rethink the overall structure of your applications to take better
         advantage of FastCGI performance gains.

         Example 1: TinyFastCGI
      </H1>
      <A NAME="4263">Here is a simple example of a responder FastCGI application written in C:</A><BR>
      <BR>
<PRE>
#include &quot;fcgi_stdio.h&quot; /* fcgi library; put it first*/<BR>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int count;

void initialize(void)
{
  count=0;
}

void main(void)
{
/* Initialization. */  
  initialize();

/* Response loop. */
  while (FCGI_Accept() &gt;= 0)   {
    printf(&quot;Content-type: text/html\r\n&quot;
           &quot;\r\n&quot;
           &quot;&lt;title&gt;FastCGI Hello! (C, fcgi_stdio library)&lt;/title&gt;&quot;
           &quot;&lt;h1&gt;FastCGI Hello! (C, fcgi_stdio library)&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;
           &quot;Request number %d running on host &lt;i&gt;%s&lt;/i&gt;\n&quot;,
            ++count, getenv(&quot;SERVER_HOSTNAME&quot;));
  }
}
</PRE>
      <H1>
         Example 2: Prime Number Generator
      </H1>
      <A NAME="4182"></A>
      <P>
         Consider a responder application that generates the n-th prime number.
      </P>
      <P>
         <A NAME="5217"></A> A CGI application would have no efficient way of solving this problem. For example, if the
         user asks for the 50,000th prime number, a CGI application would have to calculate the first prime number,
         then the second, and so on, up until the 50,000th. The application would then terminate, taking with it all
         its hard-earned calculations. If a client then asks for the 49,000th prime number, the server will have to
         spawn a new CGI application which will have to start calculating prime numbers from scratch.
      </P>
      <P>
         <A NAME="4315"></A> FastCGI applications can be much more efficient at this sort of problem, since they can
         maintain state. A FastCGI application can calculate an extensive table of prime numbers in its initialization
         phase and then keep the table around indefinitely. Whenever a client requests a particular prime number, the
         response loop merely needs to look it up in the table.
      </P>
      <P>
         <A NAME="4343"></A> Here is the code for the prime number example:

         Memory Leaks
      </H1>
      <A NAME="4178"></A>
      <P>
         Memory leaks are seldom a problem in CGI programming because CGI applications rarely run long enough to be
         concerned with leaks. However, memory leaks can become a problem in FastCGI applications, particularly if each
         call to a popular FastCGI application causes additional memory to leak.
      </P>
      <P>
         <A NAME="4785"></A> When converting to FastCGI, you can either use a tool such as Purify from Pure Software to
         discover and fix storage leaks or you can run a C garbage collector such as Great Circle from Geodesic
         Systems.
