         <A NAME="S1">1. Introduction</A>
      </H3>
      <P>
         Tcl (tool command language) is an embeddable scripting language that&#39;s often used for CGI programming. Tcl
         is freely available as a source kit.
      </P>
      <P>
         We&#39;ve built a Tcl interpreter that runs as a FastCGI application. Our purpose in doing so was twofold:
      </P>
      <UL>
         <LI>
            <I>Create a useful artifact.</I> Open Market has written many CGI applications using Tcl. Now we&#39;d like
            to turn them into FastCGI applications.
            <P>
            </P>
         </LI>
         <LI>
            <I>Demonstrate how easy it is to integrate FastCGI with an existing program.</I> The Tcl interpreter is a
            substantial program, so integrating FastCGI with the Tcl interpreter is a good test of the
            <TT>fcgi_stdio</TT> compatability library.
         </LI>
      </UL>
      <P>
         We&#39;ve succeeded on both counts. We now have a platform for migrating our Tcl-based CGI applications to
         FastCGI. And the integration required a very small effort. The only source code change to the Tcl interpreter
         was the routine addition of a handful of new commands: <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT>, <TT>FCGI_Finish</TT>,
         <TT>FCGI_SetExitStatus</TT>, and <TT>FCGI_StartFilterData</TT>.
      </P>
      <P>
         The FastCGI-integrated Tcl interpreter works as usual when run from a shell or as a CGI program. You don&#39;t
         need two Tcls, one for FastCGI and one for other uses.
      </P>
      <P>
         The remainder of this document gives a recipe you can follow to build FastCGI into Tcl, explains what&#39;s
         happening in the recipe, and illustrates the use of FastCGI Tcl with an example program.
      </P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <H3>
         <A NAME="S2">2. Recipe</A>
      </H3>
      <P>
         Here are the assumptions embedded in the following recipe:
      </P>
      <UL>
         <LI>
            You are building Tcl 7.4p3, the current stable Tcl release as this is written. You unpack the Tcl kit into
            a directory <TT>tcl7.4</TT> that&#39;s a sibling of the FastCGI kit directory <TT>fcgi-devel-kit</TT>.
            <P>
            </P>
         </LI>
         <LI>
            You have gcc version 2.7 installed on your system, and use it in the build. gcc is convenient because it
            supports the <TT>-include</TT> command-line option that instructs the C preprocessor to include a specific
            file before processing any other include files. This allows you to include <TT>fcgi_stdio.h</TT> without
            modifying Tcl source files. (The reason for specifying gcc version 2.7 is that I have experienced bad
            behavior with an earlier version and the <TT>-include</TT> flag -- the C preprocessor died with SIGABRT.)
            <P>
            </P>
         </LI>
         <LI>
            You have GNU autoconf installed on your system. If you don&#39;t have GNU autoconf, you will have to make
            certain edits by hand and repeat these edits for each build platform.<BR>
            <BR>
         </LI>
      </UL>
      <P>
         If those are valid assumptions, follow these steps:
      </P>
      <OL>
         <LI>
            <I>Build the FastCGI Developer&#39;s Kit.</I> Tcl needs to link against <TT>libfcgi.a</TT>, so <A HREF=
            "fcgi-devel-kit.htm#S2">build the FastCGI Developer&#39;s Kit</A> in order to create this library for your
            platform.

            </P>
         </LI>
         <LI>
            <I>Pull the Tcl 7.4p3 kit.</I> You&#39;ll need the files <A HREF=
            "ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/tcl7.4.tar.Z">tcl7.4.tar.Z</A>, <A HREF=

            can&#39;t perform these retrievals because of a protocol conflict between Netscape and Sun&#39;s firewall.)
            <P>
               Unpack the tar file in the parent directory of the FastCGI kit directory you used in the previous step,
               so that the directories <TT>tcl7.4</TT> and <TT>fcgi-devel-kit</TT> are siblings. After unpacking the
               tar file, follow the directions in the <TT>README</TT> to apply the patches.

         <A NAME="S3">3. Recipe Explained</A>
      </H3>
      <P>
         The recipe alone is fine if you are using Tcl 7.4p3, you have gcc version 2.7, and you have GNU autoconf. In
         case one or more of these assumptions doesn&#39;t hold for you, and to illuminate how little work was involved
         in integrating FastCGI, here&#39;s an explanation of how and why you would modify the files
         <TT>tclAppInit.c</TT>, <TT>Makefile.in</TT>, and <TT>configure.in</TT> from the Tcl kit.
      </P>

<PRE>
    if (FCGI_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }
</PRE>
                  This registers four Tcl commands (<TT>FCGI_Accept</TT>, <TT>FCGI_Finish</TT>,
                  <TT>FCGI_SetExitStatus</TT>, and <TT>FCGI_StartFilterData</TT>), implemented in <TT>tclFCGI.c</TT>,

                  <P>
                     This includes <TT>fcgi_stdio.h</TT> when compiling C code for the Tcl interpreter, overriding the
                     normal <TT>stdio</TT> types, variables, and functions.

                  <P>
                     This links the implementation of <TT>fcgi_stdio.h</TT> into the Tcl interpreter, for use by the
                     <TT>FCGI_accept</TT> command and any code that uses <TT>stdio</TT> variables or calls
                     <TT>stdio</TT> functions.

         <A NAME="S4">4. Writing FastCGI applications in Tcl</A>
      </H3>
      <P>
         The Tcl program <TT>tcl/tiny-tcl-fcgi</TT> performs the same function as the C program
         <TT>examples/tiny-fcgi.c</TT> that&#39;s used as an example in the <A HREF="fcgi-devel-kit.htm#S3.1.1">FastCGI
         Developer&#39;s Kit document</A>. Here&#39;s what the Tcl version looks like:
      </P>
      <P>
      </P>
<PRE>
#!./tclsh
set count 0 
while {[FCGI_Accept] &gt;= 0 } {
    incr count
    puts -nonewline &quot;Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n&quot;
    puts &quot;&lt;title&gt;FastCGI Hello! (Tcl)&lt;/title&gt;&quot;
    puts &quot;&lt;h1&gt;FastCGI Hello! (Tcl)&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;
    puts &quot;Request number $count running on host &lt;i&gt;$env(SERVER_NAME)&lt;/i&gt;&quot;
}
</PRE>
      <P>
         If you&#39;ve built Tcl according to the recipe and you have a Web server set up to run FastCGI applications,
         load the FastCGI Developer&#39;s Kit Index Page in that server and run this Tcl application now.
      </P>
      <P>
         The script invokes Tcl indirectly via the symbolic link <TT>examples/tclsh</TT>. It does this because HP-UX
         has a limit of 32 characters for the first line of a command-interpreter file such as
         <TT>examples/tiny-tcl-fcgi</TT>. If you run on HP-UX you won&#39;t want to sprinkle symbolic links to
         <TT>tclsh</TT> everywhere, so you should install <TT>tclsh</TT> with a shorter pathname than
         <TT>/usr/local/tcl7.4-fcgi/bin/tclsh7.4</TT>.
      </P>
      <P>
         The Tcl command <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT> treats the initial environment differently than the C function
         <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT>. The first call to the C function <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT> replaces the initial environment
         with the environment of the first request. The first call to the Tcl command <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT> adds the
         variable bindings of the first request to the bindings present in the initial environment. So when the first
         call to <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT> returns, bindings from the initial environment are still there (unless, due to
         naming conflicts, some of them have been overwritten by the first request). The next call to
         <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT> removes the bindings made on the previous call before adding a new set for the request
         just accepted, again preserving the initial environment.
      </P>
      <P>
         The FastCGI-integrated <TT>tclsh</TT> also includes commands <TT>FCGI_Finish</TT>,
         <TT>FCGI_SetExitStatus</TT>, and <TT>FCGI_StartFilterData</TT> that correspond to C functions in
         <TT>fcgi_stdio.h</TT>; see the manpages for full information.
      </P>
      <P>
         Converting a Tcl CGI application to FastCGI is not fundamentally different from converting a C CGI
         application. You separate the portion of the application that performs one-time initialization from the
         portion that performs per-request processing. You put the per-request processing into a loop controlled by
         <TT>FCGI_Accept</TT>.
