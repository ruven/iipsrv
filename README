Internet Imaging Protocol Server with Additional Panoramic Capability
--------------------------------------------------------------


ABOUT:
-----
This is an FCGI server module to handle 3D image sequences as well as 2D images
via an extended Internet Imaging Protocol (IIP). For the 3D handling, you
will need the java acohir viewer.



FEATURES:
--------
* Handles the main subset of the IIP specification
* Dynamic decoder module capability
* Caching capability for high performance
* Dynamic JPEG compression
* Fast dynamic generation of full or regions of JPEG images at any resolution
* Automatic CIELAB->sRGB colour space conversion
* 3D panoramic views
* Dynamic hillshading of 3D surface topologies



DOCUMENTATION:
-------------
Detailed class descriptions (generated using doxygen) are available in the
doc subdirectory



LICENCE:
-------
iipsrv is released under the Gnu Public License (GPL) See the copyright notice
COPYING in this directory for licensing details or go to http://www.gnu.org for
more details.

This distribution includes version 2.4.0 of the FCGI development libraries.
See COPYING.FCGI for licensing information for these libraries.



REQUIREMENTS:
------------
Requirements: libtiff and the IJG JPEG libraries. Plus, of course, an
fcgi-enabled web server. The server has been successfully tested on the
following servers:
Apache (http://httpd.apache.org),
Lighttpd (http://www.lighttpd.net)
MyServer (http://www.myserverproject.net)
Example server configurations are shown below.



BUILDING:
-------- 
The standard autoconf build process should work fine. If you want to allow
dynamic loading of 3rd party image decoders, use the configure option
--enable-modules. There is a version of the FCGI development library included
in this distribution. The configure script will use this bundled version
unless it detects one already installed. Alternatively, you may specify the
path using --with-fcgi-incl=<path> and --with-fcgi-lib=<path>.

eg.
./configure --enable-modules
make



INSTALLATION:
------------
Simply copy the executable called iipsrv.fcgi in the src subdirectory into
the web server fcgi directory. If one does not exist, simply create one, called,
for example, fcgi-bin. The web server will need to be configured to use this
executable.



CONFIGURATION:
-------------
There are several startup variables that can be passed to the server.
They are all optional.

LOGFILE: the server will log its output to the file specified, if it can.

VERBOSITY: 0 means no logging, 1 is minimal logging, 2 lots of debugging stuff,
3 even more debugging stuff and 4 a very large amount indeed ;-)

MAX_IMAGE_CACHE_SIZE: Max image cache size to be held in RAM in MB. This is
a cache of the compressed JPEG image tiles requested by the client.
The default is 10MB.

FILENAME_PATTERN: Pattern the follows the name stem for a sequence.
eg: "_pyr_" for FZ1_pyr_000_090.tif. The default is "_pyr_". This is only
relevent to 3D image sequences.

JPEG_QUALITY: The default JPEG quality factor for compression when the
client does not specify one . The value should be between 1 (highest level of
compression) and 100 (highest image quality). The default is 75.

MAX_CVT: The maximum WID or HEI allowable for CVT commands. The default
is 5000.

DECODER_MODULES: Comma separated list of modules for loading external formats.



IMAGE PATHS:
-----------
The images paths given to the server via the FIF variable must be
absolute paths on the server machine (eg. FIF=/images/test.tif) 
and not paths relative to the web server document root location.
Images do not, therefore, need to be directly accessible by the
client via the web server. Make sure the server process owner is
able to access and read the images!



EXAMPLE SERVER CONFIGURATIONS:
-----------------------------

Apache:
------
httpd.conf example extract:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Create a directory for the iipsrv binary
ScriptAlias /fcgi-bin/ "/usr/local/httpd/fcgi-bin/"

# Set the options on that directory
<Directory "/usr/local/httpd/fcgi-bin">
   AllowOverride None
   Options None
   Order allow,deny
   Allow from all
</Directory>

# Set the module handler
AddHandler fastcgi-script fcg fcgi fpl

# Initialise some variables for the FCGI server
FastCgiServer /usr/local/httpd/fcgi-bin/iipsrv.fcgi \
-initial-env LOGFILE=/tmp/iipsrv.log \
-initial-env VERBOSITY=2 \
-initial-env MAX_IMAGE_CACHE_SIZE=10 \
-initial-env FILENAME_PATTERN=_pyr_ \
-initial-env JPEG_QUALITY=50 \
-initial-env MAX_CVT=3000
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Lighttpd:
--------
lighttpd.conf example extract:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
fastcgi.server = ( "/fcgi-bin/iipsrv.fcgi" =>
  (( "host" => "127.0.0.1",
     "port" => 9000,
     "check-local" => "disable",
     "min-procs" => 1,
     "max-procs" => 1,
     "bin-path" => "/var/www/localhost/fcgi-bin/iipsrv.fcgi",
     "bin-environment" => (
        "LOGFILE" => "/tmp/iipsrv.log",
        "VERBOSITY" => "5",
        "MAX_IMAGE_CACHE_SIZE" => "10",
        "FILENAME_PATTERN" => "_pyr_",
        "JPEG_QUALITY" => "50",
        "MAX_CVT" => "3000"
      )
  ))
)
--------------------------------------------------------------------


MyServer:
--------
Simply run the MyServer configuration and in the MIME section, choose the .fcgi extension
and select:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
MIME Type: application octet-stream
Action: Execute self contained FastCGI
Manager: NONE 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
