This folder includes url shortcuts, which can be called also from Start menu
and MooViewer for viewing images from IIPImage Server.

We are using IIPMooViewer version 2.0 beta, because it is out for more than a year,
(http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/2011/08/iipmooviewer-2-0-beta/),
but you can use another version. Just add MooViewer2.0 folder here. 
Take the file index.html out of MooViewer2.0 folder and edit it in appropriated way
(change path to javascripts and css + we have added ?image parameter)
Content of index.html used in Moravian Library is included, so you can see what we have changed.

IIPImage MooViewer 2.0.url is modified/created in batch file index-Moo.bat, here is only
for easier manipulation.
